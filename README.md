# OppositeThoughtBot
A Twitter bot that tweets the opposite of what a Twitter thought leader influencer says and is therefore just as insightful. 
Feel free to fork and host your own bot for a different thought leader, just replace the handle with your own in main.py.
The code should work fine, never deployed it myself since it Twitter now requires you to subscribe to the Basic plan for fetching tweets, which is $100 per month and is $100 per month too much.
